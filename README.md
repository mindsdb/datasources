# Mindsdb Datasources

## Data sources
Our goal is to make it very simple to ingest and prepare data that can be feed into MindsDB as DataSources. Here are the basics:

mindsdb.learn from_data argument can be any of the following:

-  file: can be a path in the local system, stringio object or a url to a file, supported types are (csv, json, xlsx, xls).
- data frame: A pandas DataFrame, pandas is one of the most useful data preparation libraries out there, so it makes sense that we support this.
- MindsDB data source: MindsDB has a special class for datasources which lends itself for simple data ingestion and preparation, as well as to combine various datasources to learn from.


Note: By default, only the FileDS data source is available, to make sure the other data sources work, install mindsdb via pip install mindsdb[extra_data_sources], or replace mindsdb to mindsdb[extra_data_sources] in whatever install instructions are given for your platform

## MindsDB data source:
MindsDB datasource is an enriched version of a pandas dataframe so all methods in the pandas dataframe also apply to MindsDB, However, the DataSource class provides a way to implement data loading transformations and cleaning of data.

Some special implementations of datasources that already do cleaning and various tasks:

You can learn about them in mindsdb repository.

## FileDS
An important one is the one MindsDB uses to work with files.


from mindsdb import FileDS
```
ds = FileDS(file, clean_rows = True, custom_parser = None)
```

# Now you can pass this DataSource to MindsDB

```
mdb.learn(
    from_data=ds,
    predict='<what column you want to predict>', # the column we want to learn to predict given all the data in the file
    model_name='<the name you want to give to this model>' # the name of this model
)
```

## FileDS arguments are:

- file can be a path in the local system, stringio object or a url to a file, supported types are (csv, json, xlsx, xls).
- clean_header (default=True) clean column names, so that they don't have special characters or white spaces.
- clean_rows (default=True) Goes row by row making sure that nulls are nulls and that no corrupt data exists in them, it also cleans empty rows
- custom_parser (default=None) special function to extract the actual table structure from the file in case you need special transformations.
### S3DS
Use an s3 object as the input.

```
from mindsdb import Predictor, S3DS

s3_ds = S3DS(bucket_name='mindsdb-example-data', file_path='home_rentals.csv')

Predictor(name='test').learn(from_data=s3_ds, to_predict='target')
```

This data source also takes the optional initialization/constructor arguments:

- access_key -- The AWS access key [string]
- secret_key -- The AWS secret key [string]
- use_default_credentails -- Whether or not to use the default credentials on your machine (e.g. the credentials inside ~/.aws or the role of the machine), defaults to False [boolean]


## MySqlDS
Used to select data from MySQL or MariaDB.

```
from mindsdb import Predictor, MySqlDS

mysql_ds = MySqlDS(query="SELECT COUNT(*), SUM(spend), SUM(is_click), website FROM advertising_data", user="my_user", password="my very secret password", database="main_db", table='advertising_data', port=3306)

Predictor(name='test').learn(from_data=mysql_ds, to_predict='target')
```

This data source also takes the optional initialization/constructor arguments:

- query -- Query which extracts the data, mutually exclusive with table [string]
- host -- The host of the database (e.g. localhost or some ip) [string]
- user -- User for the database [string]
- password -- Password for the user [string]
- database -- Database to use [string]
- port -- Port of the database [integer]
- table -- Table from which to select all the data, mutually exclusive with query [string]

## PostgresDS
Used to select data from PostgreSQL.
```

from mindsdb import Predictor, PostgresDS

pg_ds = PostgresDS(query="SELECT COUNT(*), SUM(spend), SUM(is_click), website FROM advertising_data", user="my_user", password="my very secret password", database="main_db")

Predictor(name='test').learn(from_data=pg_ds, to_predict='target')
```

This data source also takes the optional initialization/constructor arguments:

- query -- Query which extracts the data, mutually exclusive with table [string]
- host -- The host of the database (e.g. localhost or some ip) [string]
- user -- User for the database [string]
- password -- Password for the user [string]
- database -- Database to use [string]
- port -- Port of the database [integer]
- table -- Table from which to select all the data, mutually exclusive with query [string]
 
 
## ClickhouseDS
Used to select data from ClickHouse.

```
from mindsdb import Predictor, ClickhouseDS

ch_ds = ClickhouseDS(query="SELECT COUNT(*), SUM(spend), SUM(is_click), website FROM default.advertising_data",
                     user="my_user", password="my very secret password")

Predictor(name='test').learn(from_data=ch_ds, to_predict='target')
```

This data source also take the optional initialization/constructor arguments:

- query -- Query with which to extract the data, mutually exclusive with table [string]
- host -- The host of the database (e.g. localhost or some ip) [string]
- user -- User for the database [string]
- password -- Password for the user [string]
- port -- Port of the database [integer]
- table -- Table from which to select all the data, mutually exclusive with query [string]
